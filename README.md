# Arduino-uno-auto-light-off-on-
Arduino Uno reads a digital LDR sensor to control a relay automatically. When light is detected (LDR HIGH), the relay turns OFF. When darkness is detected (LDR LOW), the relay turns ON. This setup is commonly used for automatic night lamps or light-based switching systems.
